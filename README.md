## WordPress Sublime Text 2

This adds autocomplete for WordPress functions, hooks and constants.

### Notes

The other WordPress sublime package was not up to date and missing stuff so I build a custom parser for grabbing data from WP core, so it can stay in tune with the WP release cycle.

    Current WP version : 3.6  
    Auto completes     : 3284

There are no snippets added to this package, you would not remember them anyhow, so build your own, also depreciated functions have been removed :smiley_cat:  

'To-do: Add WP Classes' 

### Installation

#### With Package Control

You can install WordPress Complete from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for WordPress Complete and you're done!

#### Manual

Download the .zip or git clone this into where your sublime packges are located, you can find that out by clicking "Preferences-->Browse Packages".
 

You should have this to just install it directly from sublime.. [package_control]: http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control
